# Titanic-prediction
This repository contains code and resources for a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not. The model is trained on the famous Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket class, and more.

Dependencies
To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python 3.7 or higher
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Usage
Training the Model
The main script for training the model is train_model.py. This script reads the Titanic dataset, preprocesses the data, trains a machine learning model, and saves the trained model to a file.

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Making Predictions
Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. The script predict.py reads an input CSV file containing passenger information and outputs predictions for each passenger.

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input input.csv --output output.csv
Jupyter Notebooks
The notebooks directory contains Jupyter notebooks that walk through the data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. These notebooks are provided for educational purposes and can be run interactively.

Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are printed to the console when training the model. Additionally, visualizations of the model's performance are saved in the figures directory.

Data
The Titanic dataset (data/titanic.csv) contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Pclass: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender
Age: Passenger's age
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses on board
Parch: Number of parents or children on board
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Fare paid for the ticket
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Model
The model used in this repository is a Random Forest Classifier, but other classifiers can be experimented with by modifying the train_model.py script.
